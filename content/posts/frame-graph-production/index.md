</div>

[Part III](/posts/frame-graph-advanced/) showed how the compiler can go further: async compute and split barriers. But our MVP still lives in a vacuum: one thread, one queue, resources that vanish between frames.

Production renderers operate at a different scale entirely. They run **700+ passes**, record commands across a **thread pool**, pool heaps that persist for the lifetime of the application, and integrate graph-managed code alongside rendering paths that exist outside the graph.

This article cracks open **UE5's RDG** and **Frostbite's FrameGraph** to see how they bridge that gap, then maps out the concrete steps from MVP to production.

## Declare: Pass & Resource Registration

Every engine starts the same way: passes declare what they read and write, resources are requested by description, and the graph accumulates edges. The differences are in *how* that declaration happens.

### UE5 RDG

Each `AddPass` takes a parameter struct + execute lambda. The struct *is* the setup phase: macros generate metadata, RDG extracts dependency edges:

<div class="diagram-macro">
  <div class="dm-code">
    <span style="color:var(--ds-code-light)">BEGIN_SHADER_PARAMETER_STRUCT(...)</span><br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;SHADER_PARAMETER_RDG_TEXTURE(Input)<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;RENDER_TARGET_BINDING_SLOT(Output)<br>
    <span style="color:var(--ds-code-light)">END_SHADER_PARAMETER_STRUCT()</span>
  </div>
  <div class="dm-arrow">→</div>
  <div class="dm-result">
    <span style="color:var(--ds-success)">read edge</span> ←<br>
    <span style="color:var(--ds-danger)">write edge</span> ← &nbsp;→ DAG
  </div>
</div>
<div style="font-size:.78em;opacity:.6;margin-top:-.3em">Macro generates metadata → RDG extracts dependency edges. No separate setup lambda needed.</div>

**Pass flags** control queue and behavior: `ERDGPassFlags::Raster`, `::Compute`, `::AsyncCompute`, `::NeverCull`, `::Copy`. **Resources** are either transient (`CreateTexture`: graph-owned, eligible for aliasing) or imported (`RegisterExternalTexture`: externally owned, barriers tracked but no aliasing).

<div style="display:flex;gap:1em;flex-wrap:wrap;margin:1em 0">

</div>

### Frostbite

Frostbite's GDC 2017 talk described a similar lambda-based declaration: setup lambda declares reads/writes, execute lambda records GPU commands. The exact current implementation isn't public.

### What's different from our MVP

<div class="diagram-ftable">
<table>
  <tr><th>Declaration aspect</th><th>Our MVP</th><th>Production engines</th></tr>
  <tr><td><strong>Edge declaration</strong></td><td>Explicit <code>read()</code> / <code>write()</code> / <code>readWrite()</code> calls in setup lambda</td><td>UE5: macro-generated metadata. Frostbite: lambda-based, similar to MVP.</td></tr>
  <tr><td><strong>Resource creation</strong></td><td>Transient (<code>CreateResource</code>) + imported (<code>ImportResource</code>), imported tracked for barriers but not aliased</td><td>Same distinction, plus cross-frame heap pooling, placed sub-allocation, and size bucketing.</td></tr>
  <tr><td><strong>Queue assignment</strong></td><td>Single queue</td><td>Per-pass flags: graphics, compute, async compute, copy</td></tr>
  <tr><td><strong>Rebuild</strong></td><td>Full rebuild every frame</td><td>UE5: hybrid (cached topology, invalidated on change). Others: dynamic rebuild.</td></tr>
</table>
</div>

## Compile: The Graph Compiler at Scale

This is where production engines diverge most from our MVP. The compile phase runs entirely on the CPU, between declaration and execution. Our MVP does five things here: topo-sort, cull, scan lifetimes, alias, and compute barriers. Production engines do the same five, plus async compute scheduling, split barrier placement, and barrier batching.

<div class="diagram-phases">
  <div class="dph-col" style="border-color:var(--ds-code-light);flex:1;">
    <div class="dph-title" style="color:var(--ds-code-light)">MVP compile</div>
    <div class="dph-body" style="font-size:.84em;">
      ├ topo-sort<br>
      ├ cull dead passes<br>
      ├ scan lifetimes<br>
      ├ alias memory<br>
      └ compute barriers
    </div>
  </div>
  <div style="display:flex;align-items:center;font-size:1.4em;color:var(--ds-code-light);font-weight:700">→</div>
  <div class="dph-col" style="border-color:var(--ds-indigo);flex:1.4;">
    <div class="dph-title" style="color:var(--ds-indigo)">Production compile</div>
    <div class="dph-body" style="font-size:.84em;">
      ├ topo-sort<br>
      ├ cull dead passes<br>
      ├ scan lifetimes<br>
      ├ alias memory <span style="opacity:.5">+ cross-frame pooling</span><br>
      ├ <strong>schedule async compute</strong><br>
      ├ compute barriers <span style="opacity:.5">+ split begin/end</span><br>
      └ <strong>batch barriers</strong>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

Every step below is a compile-time operation. No GPU work, no command recording. The compiler sees the full DAG and makes optimal decisions the pass author never has to think about.

### Pass culling

Same algorithm as our MVP (backward reachability from the output), but at larger scale. UE5 uses refcount-based culling and skips allocation entirely for culled passes (saves transient allocator work). Culled passes never execute, never allocate resources, never emit barriers. They vanish as if they were never declared.

### Memory aliasing

Both engines use the same core algorithm from [Part II](/posts/frame-graph-build-it/): lifetime scanning + free-list allocation. The production refinements:

<div class="diagram-ftable">
<table>
  <tr><th>Refinement</th><th>UE5 RDG</th><th>Frostbite (GDC talk)</th></tr>
  <tr><td><strong>Placed resources</strong></td><td>Transient allocator (<code>r.RDG.TransientAllocator</code>) binds into <code>ID3D12Heap</code> offsets</td><td>Heap sub-allocation</td></tr>
  <tr><td><strong>Size bucketing</strong></td><td>Power-of-two in transient allocator</td><td>Custom bin sizes</td></tr>
  <tr><td><strong>Cross-frame pooling</strong></td><td>Persistent pool, peak-N-frames sizing</td><td>Heaps persisted across frames, reallocated only when peak demand grew, using the same high-water-mark strategy most engines use</td></tr>
  <tr><td><strong>Imported aliasing</strong></td><td><span style="color:var(--ds-danger)">❌</span> transient only</td><td>Described as supported for resources whose lifetimes are fully known within the frame</td></tr>
</table>
</div>

Our MVP allocates fresh each frame. Production engines **pool across frames**: once a heap is allocated, it persists and gets reused. UE5's transient allocator (controlled via `r.RDG.TransientAllocator`) tracks peak usage over several frames and only grows the pool when needed. Frostbite described the same pattern at GDC 2017: heaps survive across frames, the allocator remembers the high-water mark, and unused blocks are released only after several frames of lower demand, avoiding the alloc/free churn that would otherwise dominate the CPU cost of transient resources. This amortizes allocation cost to near zero in steady state.

### Async compute scheduling

Async compute lets the GPU overlap independent work on separate hardware queues: compute shaders running alongside rasterization. The compiler must identify which passes can safely run async, insert cross-queue fences, and manage resource ownership transfers.

| Engine | Approach | Discovery |
|--------|----------|-----------|
| **UE5** | Opt-in via `ERDGPassFlags::AsyncCompute` per pass | Manual: compiler trusts the flag, handles fence insertion + cross-queue sync |
| **Frostbite** | Described as automatic in GDC talk | Reachability analysis in the compiler |

**Hardware reality:** NVIDIA uses separate async engines. AMD exposes more independent CUs. Some GPUs just time-slice, so always profile to confirm real overlap. Vulkan requires explicit queue family ownership transfer. D3D12 uses `ID3D12Fence`. Both are expensive. Only use them if the overlap wins exceed the transfer cost.

### Barrier batching & split barriers

Our MVP inserts one barrier at a time. Production engines batch multiple transitions into a single API call and split barriers across pass gaps for better GPU pipelining.

UE5 batches multiple resource transitions into a single API call rather than issuing one barrier per resource. Split barriers place the "begin" transition as early as possible and the "end" just before the resource is needed, giving the GPU time to pipeline the transition.

Diminishing returns on desktop. Modern drivers hide barrier latency internally. Biggest wins on expensive layout transitions (depth to shader-read) and console GPUs with more exposed pipeline control. Add last, and only if profiling shows barrier stalls.

---

## Execute: Recording & Submission

After the compiler finishes, every decision has been made: pass order, memory layout, barrier placement, physical resource bindings. The execute phase just walks the plan and records GPU commands. No allocation happens here. That's all done during compile, which makes execute safe to parallelize and the compiled plan cacheable across frames. Here's where production engines scale beyond our MVP.

### Parallel command recording

Our MVP records on a single thread. Production engines split the sorted pass list into groups and record each group on a separate thread using secondary command buffers (Vulkan) or command lists (D3D12), then merge at submit.

UE5 creates parallel `FRHICommandList` instances (one per pass group) and joins them before queue submission. This is where the bulk of CPU frame time goes in a graph-based renderer, so parallelizing it matters.

### Bindless & the frame graph

Traditional bound descriptors require the executor to know each pass's binding layout (which slots expect textures, which expect UAVs) and to set up descriptor sets or root signatures before every dispatch. Bindless flips that: one global descriptor heap holds every resource, and shaders index into it directly (`ResourceDescriptorHeap[idx]`). This changes the execute loop significantly.

<div class="diagram-ftable">
<table>
  <tr><th>Concern</th><th>Bound descriptors</th><th>Bindless</th></tr>
  <tr><td><strong>Execute loop</strong></td><td>Executor builds a per-pass descriptor set matching the pass's root signature layout</td><td>One root signature for all passes: executor just passes integer indices</td></tr>
  <tr><td><strong>Descriptor lifetime</strong></td><td>Managed by API: bind, draw, release</td><td>Frame graph manages heap slots: allocate on resource creation, free when the resource is culled or the frame ends</td></tr>
  <tr><td><strong>Aliased resources</strong></td><td>Descriptors implicitly invalidated on rebind</td><td>Two aliased resources share memory but have <em>different</em> descriptor indices, and the graph must invalidate or recycle the old slot to prevent stale access</td></tr>
  <tr><td><strong>Validation</strong></td><td>API validates state at bind time</td><td>No API-level safety: the graph's <code>read()</code>/<code>write()</code> declarations become the <em>only</em> correctness check</td></tr>
</table>
</div>

Bindless doesn't change the DAG or the compile phase: sorting, culling, aliasing, and barriers work identically. What it simplifies is the *execution* side: the executor becomes a thin loop that sets a few root constants and dispatches, because every resource is already visible in the global heap. The cost is that you lose API-level validation. A missed `read()` declaration won't trigger a binding error, it'll silently access stale data.

### The RDG–legacy boundary (UE5)

The biggest practical consideration with RDG is the seam between RDG-managed passes and legacy `FRHICommandList` code. At this boundary:

- Barriers must be inserted manually (RDG can't see what the legacy code does)
- Resources must be extracted from RDG before legacy code can use them
- Re-importing back into RDG requires `RegisterExternalTexture()` with correct state tracking

This boundary is shrinking every release as Epic migrates more passes to RDG, but in practice you'll still hit it when integrating third-party plugins or older rendering features.

## Closing

A render graph is not always the right answer. If your project has a fixed pipeline with 3–4 passes that will never change, the overhead of a graph compiler is wasted complexity. But the moment your renderer needs to *grow* (new passes, new platforms, new debug tools), the graph pays for itself in the first week.

Across these four articles, we covered the full arc: [Part I](/posts/frame-graph-theory/) laid out the core theory: the declare/compile/execute lifecycle, sorting, culling, barriers, and aliasing. [Part II](/posts/frame-graph-build-it/) turned that into working C++. [Part III](/posts/frame-graph-advanced/) pushed further with async compute and split barriers. And this article mapped those ideas onto what ships in UE5 and Frostbite, showing how production engines implement the same concepts at scale.

You can now open `FRDGBuilder` in UE5 and *read* it, not reverse-engineer it. You know what `AddPass` builds, how the transient allocator aliases memory, why `ERDGPassFlags::AsyncCompute` exists, and how the RDG boundary with legacy code works in practice.

The point isn't that every project needs a render graph. The point is that if you understand how they work, you'll make a better decision about whether *yours* does.
